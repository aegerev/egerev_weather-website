## Installation

No third-party applications were installed during the making of this website.

## Usage

When a user searches for a given city, he/she types in the name of the city. A dropdown list pops up, displaying the weather for the city in different countries/states. (Yes, some states and countries have similar names.) As soon as the person clicks on the city, a button is displayed to get the information for that city. 
When the user clicks on the button, the weather (both the current weather and the 5-day forecast) show, and the button goes straight to local storage.

When the person refreshes the page, the buttons are still there.

NOTE: This website comes pre-loaded with 6 Cities: Media, Illinois; Chester, England (Great Britain); Princeton, New Jersey; Yardley, Pennsylvania; Guanajuato, Mexico; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. My colleague, Leo, helped me out with the project. In fact, I should tell you that the website template was once his project - he was working on this way back in 2010. Now, 13 years later, he is giving this template to me. This is seen in my project.

2. Calling APIs using the 'fetch' method was SUPER hard. Good thing Professor Maddatu helped me out with that by giving me the tools needed and helping me out during Office Hours. Thanks, Professor!

3. I tried doing JSON Parse to get the necessary information for the website to work. Luckily, w3Schools was there to help me out. (https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_json_parse.asp). It's on display in my script.js file.

4. In order to satisfy the acceptance criteria, I have Open Weather 5-Day Forecast API documentation. It is on full display in my code. (
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5). I also used the Open Weather Geo 1.0 API to get the latitude and longitude for the given city. (https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct)
