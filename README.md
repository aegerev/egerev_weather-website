## Installation

No third-party applications were installed during the making of this website.

## Usage

When a user searches for a given city, he/she types in the name of the city. A dropdown list pops up, displaying the weather for the city in different countries/states. (Yes, some states and countries have similar names.) As soon as the person clicks on the city, a button is displayed to get the information for that city. 
When the user clicks on the button, the weather (both the current weather and the 5-day forecast) show, and the button goes straight to local storage.

When the person refreshes the page, the buttons are still there.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. My colleague, Leo, helped me out with the project. In fact, I should tell you that the website template was once his project - he was working on this way back in 2010. Now, 13 years later, he is giving this template to me. This is seen in my project.

2. Calling APIs using the 'fetch' method was SUPER hard. Good thing Professor Maddatu helped me out with that by 

3. I tried getting the value of the text, and the jQuery API Documentation for parent() (.parent() | jQuery API Documentation) helped me out. It's in Javascript. The child is OK.

4. To ensure that I had the code to create the 'past, present, future' blocks, I decided to create <div> elements inside my Javascript file. I used two links to make that happen: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/867916/creating-a-div-element-in-jquery) and (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10283414/jquery-add-div-with-class-definition). 

5. In order to satisfy the acceptance criteria, I have used the Day.js() documentation. It is on full display in my code. (https://day.js.org/).
